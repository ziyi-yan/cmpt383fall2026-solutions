# Python Problem Set

The questions on the Python quiz will mainly be variations of the questions
below, or questions that are similar.

Questions may be updated or added as the course progresses.

Please post your answers to the discussion board to share with other students.

**Important**: *Treat these problem-sets as non-AI activities!* Turn off all AI
support and try to figure them out yourself. Having AI or another student do
this for you will not help you learn. You must do the learning yourself!

**NOTE(Ziyi)**: My sample solutions do not guarantee to have complete answers
to any short answer questions, e.g. Question 1. They are more of
guidelines and hints for you to answer them with your own words.

## Question 1

In your own words, explain to a beginning CMPT 120 student what a **list
comprehension** is in Python. How is it related to mathematical set notation?

The list comprehension is a notation, compared to list literals, that allows
you to express the content of a list declaratively.

1. Explain what is List literals: `[1, 2, 3]`, `["ziyi", "yan", "sfu", "python"]`.
2. Draw a connection between list comprehension and math notation of a set/list:
    a. Math notation of sets/lists: $\\{x^2 : x \in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\} \\}$.
    b. Python List Comprehension: `[x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]`.
3. Refer to the official docs: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions

## Question 2

Write list comprehensions to do the following:

- Make a list of all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 5, e.g.
  `[5, 10, 15, ...]`.

```python
[x for x in range(100) if x % 5 == 0]
```

- Remove from a given list all the strings of even length.

```python
strs = ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'ziyi', 'cmpt']
[s for s in strs if len(s) % 2 != 0]
```

- Remove from a given list all the 0s, *add* 1 to all negative numbers, and
  *subtract* 1 from all positive numbers. For instance, `[0, 2, -2, 0, -3]`
  becomes `[1, -1, -2]`.

```python
xs = [0, 2, -2, 0, -3]
[x+1 if x < 0 else x-1 for x in xs if x != 0]
```

`x if cond else y`: Python's conditional expression: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions

- Make a list of all 4-bit tuples, e.g. `[(0,0,0,0), (0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 0), ...]`.

```python
[(w, x, y, z) for w in range(2) for x in range(2) for y in range(2) for z in range(2)]
```

- Given three lists, generate all 3-tuples of `(a, b, c)` where `a` is from the
  first list, `b` is from the second list, `c` is from the third list, and `a`,
  `b`, and `c` are all different.

```python
A = [1, 2, 3]
B = [1, 4, 5]
C = [1, 3, 5]
[(a, b, c) for a in A for b in B for c in C if a != b if b != c if a != c]
```

- Make a list of all integer solutions to the equation `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`. Assume
  `a`, `b`, and `c` are all integers between 1 and 100, and `a < b < c`. Write
  each solution as a tuple `(a, b, c)`. The list starts and ends with: `[(3, 4,
  5), (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), ..., (60, 80, 100), (65, 72, 97)]`.

```python
[(a, b, c) for a in range(100) for b in range(100) for c in range(100) if a < b < c if a**2 + b**2 == c**2]
```

## Question 3

In Python, what is the **walrus operator**? What is used for? Give an example.

The walrus operator is used to eliminate unnecessary computation.

If there are computations happening in the if-condition evaluation,
the results can be saved and used in the final outputs.

Example from lecture notes:
```python
high_scores = [(n, score)
               for n in all_names 
               if (score := get_score(n)) % 5 != 0  # walrus operator used here
              ]
```

Refer to lecture notes: https://github.com/tjd1234/cmpt383fall2026/blob/main/python/README.md#the-walrus-operator

## Question 4

a) Write a function called `my_zip2(A, B)` that takes two lists, `A` and `B`, of
the same size. It should return a list of tuples just like `zip`.

```python
def my_zip2(A, B):
    return [(A[i], B[i]) for i in range(min(len(A), len(B))]
```

b) Using `my_zip2` and `sum`, show how to calculate the **dot product** of two
lists of numbers. Assume the lists are non-empty, only contain numbers, and have
the same length.

For example, the dot product of `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` is `1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6
= 32`.
```python
A = [1, 2, 3]
B = [4, 5, 6]
sum(a * b for (a, b) in my_zip2(A, B))
```

c) Write a function called `my_zip(L1, L2, ..., Ln)` that takes $n \geq 2$ lists
(all the same size) as input and returns a list of tuples just like `zip`. If
$n$ is less than 2, then raise a `ValueError`.

```pyhton
# variadic function
def my_zip(*lsts):
    if len(lsts) < 2:
        raise ValueError
    min_len = min(len(lst) for lst in lsts)
    zipped = []
    for i in range(min_len):
        row = []
        for lst in lsts:
            row.append(lst[i])
        zipped.append(tuple(row))
    return zipped

# usage of a variadic function
my_zip()
# lsts: []
my_zip(1, 2, 3)
# lsts: [1, 2, 3]

for i in my_zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]): print(i)
for i in zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]): print(i)
```

d) Using `my_zip`, write a function called `add_lists(L1, L2, ..., Ln)` that
adds lists `L1` to `Ln` element-wise. You can assume they are all the same size
(and non-empty), and all list of numbers.

For example, `add_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 1, 1])` should return `[6, 8, 10]`.

```python
def add_lists(*lsts):
    return [sum(row) for row in my_zip(*lsts)]

add_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 1, 1])
```

## Question 5

Write a function called `make_numbered_list(lst)` that takes a list of strings
and returns a string that is formatted as a numbered list as shown.

Make a few variations of this function, at least:

- One that uses a loop (and `enumerate`).

```python
def make_numbered_list(lst):
    for idx, elem in enumerate(lst):
        print("{}. {}".format(idx+1, elem))
```

- One that uses list comprehensions (and `enumerate`).

```python
def make_numbered_list(lst):
    numbered = ["{}. {}".format(idx+1, elem) for idx, elem in enumerate(lst)]
    for row in numbered:
        print(row)
```

- One whose body is as short as possible (i.e. a single `return` statement).

```python
def make_numbered_list(lst):
    return [print("{}. {}".format(idx+1, elem)) for idx, elem in enumerate(lst)]
```


For example:

```
result = make_numbered_list(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
print(result)
```

Should print:

```
1. apple
2. banana
3. cherry
```

## Question 6

Write a function called `get_max(lst)` that uses `enumerate` to return the
largest value in the list. Assume the list is non-empty and is either all
numbers or all strings.

For example, `get_max([4, 8, 4, 1])` should return 8, and `get_max(['soap',
'cat', 'dog'])` should return `'soap'`.

```python
def get_max(lst):
    if isinstance(lst[0], str):
        max_str = len(lst[0])
        max_idx = 0
        for idx, s in enumerate(lst):
            if len(s) > max_str:
                max_str = len(s)
                max_idx = idx
        return lst[max_idx]
    else:
        return max(lst)

# using built-in max() with customized key function
def get_max(lst):
    return max(lst, key=lambda elem: len(elem) if isinstance(elem, str) else elem)
```

## Question 7

In your own words, explain Python's **iterator protocol**. What are the methods
required? What happens when there is no more data to iterate over?

1. Iterator protocol is a set of methods that a iterator need to have to be qualified as a iterator.
   List the method and explain the semantics of each. Refer to the lecture notes.
2. `next()` will throw a iterator-specific error: `StopIteration`

## Question 8

Using the **iterator protocol**, write an iterator class that iterates over the
letters of a given string in *reverse* order.

For example:

```python
for c in My_reversed('cat'):
    print(c)
```

should output:

```
t
a
c
```

```python
class My_reversed:
    def __init__(self, s):
        self.s = s
        self.index = len(s)
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.index > 0:
            self.index -= 1
            return self.s[self.index]
        else:
            raise StopIteration
```

## Question 9

In your own words, explain to another programmer what it means that Python
strings are **iterable** but not **iterators**.

iterable and iterator are specific concepts in Python. Only a object that meets the iterable/iterator protocol is a iterable/iterator.

Python doc of definiton of iterator and iterable:
https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator
https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable


## Question 10

Using the **iterator protocol**, write your own class version of `enumerate`
called `My_enumerate` that works with lists.

For example:

```python
for i, v in My_enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']):
    print(i, v)
```

should output:

```
0 a
1 b
2 c
```

```python
class My_enumerate:
    def __init__(self, lst):
        self.lst = lst
        self.idx = 0
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    def __next__(self):
        if self.idx < len(self.lst):
            t = (self.idx, self.lst[self.idx])
            self.idx += 1
            return t
        else:
            raise StopIteration
```

## Question 11

Write a **generator function** (using `yield`) to make your own version of each
of these built-in functions:

- `my_range_gen(a, b)` works the same as `range(a, b)`, i.e. it generates the
  numbers from `a`, `a + 1`, `a + 2`, ..., `b - 1`.

```python
def my_range_gen(a, b):
    curr = a
    while curr < b:
        yield curr
        curr += 1
```
  
- `my_zip2_gen(A, B)` works the same as `zip(A, B)`, i.e. it generates the pairs
  of elements from `A` and `B`. You can assume `A` and `B` are lists of the same
  length, there are only two lists.

```python
def my_zip2_gen(a, b):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        yield a[i], b[i]
```

## Question 12

Write a generator function (using `yield`) called `longer_than_gen(n, lst)` that
generates all the strings in `lst` that are longer than `n`. For example:

```python
pets = ['cat', 'hamster','dog', 'bird']
for s in longer_than_gen(3, pets):
    print(s)
```

Should print:

```
hamster
bird
```

```python
def longer_than_gen(n, lst):
    for s in lst:
        if len(s) > n:
            yield s
```

## Question 13

Write a generator function (using `yield`) called `lines_of_file_gen(filename)`
that generates the line number and the line of a text file one at a time. For
example, suppose the file `joke.txt` contains the following text:

```
Who's there?
A broken pencil.
A broken pencil who?
Never mind. It's pointless.
```

Then:

```python
for i, line in lines_of_file_gen('jokes.txt'):
    print(f'{i + 1}: {line}')
```

Should print:

```
1: Who's there?
2: A broken pencil.
3: A broken pencil who?
4: Never mind. It's pointless.
```

```python
def lines_of_file_gen(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        for i, line in enumerate(f):
            line = line.strip()
            yield i, line
```

## Question 14

Write a function called `make_bounds_checker(min, max)` that returns a
**closure** that checks if a given value is greater than or equal to `min` and
less than or equal to `max`.

For example:

```python
good_score = make_bounds_checker(0, 100)
print(good_score(50)) # True
print(good_score(101)) # False

is_teen = make_bounds_checker(13, 19)
print(is_teen(15)) # True
print(is_teen(12)) # False
print(is_teen(20)) # False
```

```python
def make_bounds_checker(min, max):
    def checker(x):
        return x > min and x < max
    return checker
```

## Question 15

In your own words, explain to another programmer what a Python **decorator** is.
Give an example of how to use one.

A decorator is a function that takes another function as a input and return a modifed version of that function as an output.

Usage:
```
# raw
decorated = deco(fun)
# with syntax sugar
@deco
def fun():
    pass
```

## Question 16

Write a Python decorator called `always_return_str` that ensures a function
always returns its results as a string.

For example:

```python
@always_return_str
def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 'one'
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return [1, 2, 3]
    else:
        return ''

# isinstance(x, str) returns True if x is a string, and False
# otherwise
print(f(1), isinstance(f(1), str))
print(f(2), isinstance(f(2), str))
print(f(3), isinstance(f(3), str))
print(f(4), isinstance(f(4), str))
```

Prints:

```
one True
2 True
[1, 2, 3] True
 True
```

```python
def always_return_str(f):
    def new_f(*args, **kwargs):
        r = f(*args, **kwargs)
        if not isinstance(r, str):
            return str(r)
        return r
    return new_f
```

## Question 17

Write a context manager called `LoggedTimer` that measures the time taken to run
a block of code and logs the results in a file. It should work like this:

```python
with LoggedTimer('timer.log') as t:
    t.log("Starting sleep ...   ")
    time.sleep(1)
    t.log("Done sleeping!")

print('Done!')
```

When run this is printed on the console:

```
Logged to timer.log
Done!
```

The file `timer.log` contains:

```
Started at 3817326.148478291
Starting sleep ...   
Done sleeping!
Stopped at 3817327.1535275
Elapsed: 1.005 seconds
```

In the context manager, use the `__init__` method to store the filename.

## Question 18

Write a function called `classify_grade(score)` that uses the `match` statement
that returns as string grade for the given score (as shown below). You can
assume `score` is an integer between 0 and 100. 

The grades are:

- A for scores 90 or higher
- B for scores 80 to 89
- C for scores 70 to 79
- D for scores 50 to 69
- F for scores 0 to 49

For example:

```python
print(classify_grade(95))   # A
print(classify_grade(80))   # B
print(classify_grade(79))   # C
print(classify_grade(62))   # D
print(classify_grade(48))   # F
```

## Question 19

Write a function called `calculate_area(shape)` that uses `match` to calculate
and return (not print!) the area of a given shape. You can assume the shape is
one of the following:

- `circle` with radius `r`
- `rectangle` with width `w` and height `h`
- `triangle` with base `b` and height `h`
- `square` with side length `s`

`shape` is a tuple whose first element is the shape type and the remaining
elements are the shape's parameters.

For example:

```python
print(calculate_area(("circle", 5)))       # 78.539...
print(calculate_area(("rectangle", 4, 6))) # 24
print(calculate_area(("triangle", 3, 8)))  # 12.0
print(calculate_area(("square", 7)))       # 49
print(calculate_area(("hexagon", 4)))      # Unknown shape
```
